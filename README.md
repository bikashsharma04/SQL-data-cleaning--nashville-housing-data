# SQL-data-cleaning--nashville-housing-data
Nashville housing data consist of housing data of 50000+ property data, listing information regarding properties that are sold or vacant and other information like property address, owner's address, sales information, type of property, etc. 
Data is in raw form and needs to be cleaned for future analysis and a better understanding of business.

I used Microsoft SQL Server for database management and data cleaning, using complex SQL queries, to make the data easy to read and analyze.

 --raw data is attached below as SQL queries as well.
